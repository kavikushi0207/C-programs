# C-programs

#program01
a C program that will do the following 
Get the lower limit and upper limit from the user which should be positive integers.
The program should ADD all integer numbers between the two limits (including the lower and upper limits) which are NOT multiples of 3.
The program will then show the summation of all numbers for the given range.

#program02
a program that reads a nonnegative integer and computes and prints its factorial. 

#program03
a program that estimates the value of the mathematical constant e

#program04
a program that computes the value of exponential of x. Here x is a floating-point number input by the user.

#program05
a program to calculate and print the sum of all multiples of 7 from 1 to 100.

#program06
a program that prints the sum, the sum of the squares, and the sum of the cubes of all natural numbers from 1 till any number entered by the user.

#program07
a program that converts temperatures from 30C to 50C to the Fahrenheit scale. The program should print a table displaying temperatures in the two scales side by side.
